        <p>
            By registering for and using the TDEI portal and/or its associated tools, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms:
        </p>

        <h3>Purpose of TDEI</h3>
        <p>
            The TDEI portal and associated tools is a tool developed by the University of Washington’s Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) to collect, aggregate, and share transportation data to support accessibility, equity, and mobility research and applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Contribution, Ownership & Licensing</h3>
        <p>
            By publishing data via the <strong>TDEI portal and associated tools</strong>, you affirm that you own the rights to the data or have the legal authority to submit it under the licensing terms provided below. You also acknowledge that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may choose to keep contributed data private while it is in a "pre-release status". Data in pre-release status will only be accessible to you, people you authorize in your organization and authorized TCAT personnel for review, validation, and internal research.</li>
            <li>Once you "opt to publish" data, it may be publicly available and incorporated into "derivative works" created by TDEI or third parties, including but not limited to trip planners, transportation network analyses, and accessibility research.</li>
            <li>You grant TCAT, the University of Washington, and their assignees a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, and create derivative works based on the data in accordance with the terms of the selected license.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When publishing data, you will have the option to license your contributions under one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Database License (ODbL)</strong> – Ensures data remains open while allowing modifications and requiring attribution and share-alike terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)</strong> – Allows unrestricted use, distribution, and modification of the data, as long as proper attribution is given.</li>
            <li><strong>Creative Commons Zero (CC0, Public Domain Dedication)</strong> – Waives all rights, allowing unrestricted reuse without attribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you do not select a license at the time of submission, your data will automatically be licensed under CC0 (Public Domain Dedication) to maximize openness and usability.</p>

        <p>To the extent that you assert ownership rights over the data you contribute, you grant TCAT, the University of Washington, and their assignees a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, and create derivative works based on the data in accordance with the terms of the selected license. This includes the right to integrate the data into publicly accessible datasets, develop analytical tools, and support research, policy, and accessibility initiatives.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Data & Liability</h3>
        <p>You agree that you will not submit data that you do not have the right to share or that infringes on third-party intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or contractual obligations. You also agree to indemnify and hold harmless TCAT, the University of Washington, and its affiliates from any claims arising from your contribution of unauthorized data.</p>

        <h3>Data Removal, Modification & Pre-Release Status</h3>
        <p><strong>User-Initiated Deletion:</strong> The TDEI interface provides users the ability to remove their data from public view and from within their own organization. If you delete data through the TDEI interface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The data will no longer be accessible to you, your organization, or other users of the TDEI portal.</li>
            <li>Any applications or analyses relying on that data through TDEI will no longer have access to it.</li>
            <li>TCAT retains an archival copy of the data for historical, research, and compliance purposes.</li>
            <li>TCAT retains the right to preserve existing derivative works that have incorporated your data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deleted data will not be reintroduced into public datasets unless explicitly republished by the contributor.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-Release Status & Private Data:</strong> You may keep data private by leaving it as "pre-release" at the time of submission. Pre-release data will remain inaccessible to the public until you choose to publish it.</p>

        <p><strong>TCAT’s Right to Modify or Remove Data:</strong> TCAT reserves the right to reject, modify, or remove any contributed data that is inaccurate, misleading, inappropriate, or otherwise incompatible with TDEI’s mission.</p>

        <h3>Attribution & Transparency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Any data you publish via the TDEI portal will be associated with the email address used during registration.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data Integrity & Security</h3>
