            TDEI is a tool developed by the University of Washington's Taskar Center for Accessible Technology (TCAT) to
            improve accessibility data of sidewalk infrastructure via the collection, aggregation, processing, and
            sharing of data related to the accessibility features of pedestrian infrastructure.
        </p>

            help those with sidewalk preferences find suitable routes within their local communities.
